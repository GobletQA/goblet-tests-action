## Example usage

### Basic
```yaml
- name: Run Goblet Tests
  uses: gobletqa/goblet-tests-action@0.0.1
  with:
    report: ${{ github.sha }}
```

### With Tracing and Video Recording
```yaml
- name: Run Goblet Tests
  uses: gobletqa/goblet-tests-action@0.0.1
  with:
    git-token: ${{ github.token }}
    test-tracing: true
    test-record: true
```

### Alt repo
```yaml
- name: Run Goblet Tests
  uses: gobletqa/goblet-tests-action@0.0.1
  with:
    alt-branch: develop # defaults to the repos default branch branch. I.E. main / master
    alt-repo: github.com/octokitty/app-tests # URI to the repo, EXCLUDING the protocol I.E. github.com/owner/repo.git
    alt-token: secrets.ALT_TEST_REPO_TOKEN # Must be a OAuth or PAT that has access to the alternative repository
    alt-user: secrets.ALT_TEST_USER # User related to the git token used for the `alt-token` input
    alt-email: secrets.ALT_TEST_EMAIL # Email related to the git token used for the `alt-token` input and user
``` 

## Local Development
### Requirements
* The `keg-cli`, `docker`, and `yarn` must be installed locally
  * You must also login to the container registry with a user that has access to the GobletQA repo and container registry 
* A local copy of the core GobletQA repo 

### Setup
* The `/scripts` folder contains a number of helper scripts to manage the Docker image
* These scripts should be executed via yarn, as shown below
  * `yarn docker:run` || `yarn dr` - Runs the built docker image and automatically executes the goblet tests 
  * `yarn docker:dev` || `yarn dd` - Runs the built docker image and attaches to a `bash` shell
    * `/goblet-action/entrypoint.sh` - To manually run tests, when connected to the container
      * Example: `GOBLET_BROWSERS=chrome /goblet-action/entrypoint.sh select-strategy.feature`
